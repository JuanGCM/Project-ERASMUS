# Project-ERASMUS
It's a project that I developed in Italy, Valdocco for the students in Salesianos School.

*Backend:

Have IntelliJ IDEA installed to be able to open and run the server.

IntelliJ IDEA Link (Community): https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/#section=windows

Open the project in java 11

In order to run the server inside Intellij IDEA go to "Run/Debug Configurations" and in the "Run" part write "bootrun".

Then you just have to press the "start" icon.


*Frontend: 

First unzip the "Frontend" file,then you have to open the folder with "Visual Studio Code"

Visual Studio Code link: https://code.visualstudio.com

In the menu,go to Terminal and then "new Terminal",inside the terminal you have to write "npm install" to download the "node_modules" folder(without that the front doesn't work).

To use Angular, you have to download:

-npm for windows 

-angular CLI for windows

*Instructions when the project starts:
First have to login with the username: "admin" and the password: "cnos"
You can choose to go to the users list or to the works list.
You can create a new user, then you can edit it or delete it.
If you click on the user name, it going to send you to the user profile where there's the entire information of the user and the user works
In the works list you can create a new work, edit it and delete it.
